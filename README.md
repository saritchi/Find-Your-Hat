# Find Your Hat

A terminal-based game where the goal is to find your hat in a randomly generated maze.

## General Information

Find Your Hat is a JavaScript app which randomly generates a maze based on the rows, columns, and difficulty inputted by the user. Before the game begins, the [Breadth-First Search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) (BFS) is applied to the generated maze. BFS ensures that all possible maze generations are solvable. This is a JavaScript project, from Codeacademy's Full Stack Developer course.
